Detect Fraudulent Credit Card transactions using different Machine Learning models and compare performances

In this notebook, I explore various Machine Learning models to detect fraudulent use of Credit cards. I compare each model performance and results. The best performance is achieved using SMOTE technique.

Please note that this approach can be transferred to other detection analysis in alternatrive domains. The feature extraction process remains similar and can be replicated on many other detection issues.
